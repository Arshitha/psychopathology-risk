#### README
All custom code goes into this directory. All scripts should be written such
that they can be executed from the root of the dataset, and are only using
relative paths for portability.


The most recent code is saved in the ~/code/new directory
1. psychrisk_exploration.ipynb: Python script to extract variables of interest from the ABCD dataset
1. LME_PsychRisk_scv.ipynb: R script for linear mixed models using the lme4/lmerTest packages to examine the effect of parental psychopathology (Addiction, Depression, Mania, Nervousness; main + interaction effects) on subcortical brain volumes (15 dependent variables).  


Older code is saved in the ~/code/tests directory
